Cost Optimization,Set up a disaster recovery strategy that splits the application components and data into defined groups,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/guidance-best-practices,Medium,Application Design,Design,50,"Exclude disk  provides an efficient and cost-effective choice to selectively back up critical data. For example, back up only one disk when you don't want to back up the rest of the disks attached to a VM. This is also useful when you have multiple backup solutions. For example, when you back up your databases or data with a workload backup solution (SQL Server database in Azure VM backup) and you want to use Azure VM level backup for selected disks."
Cost Optimization,Understand the cost implications of Availability Zones,https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/availability-zones/,Medium,Application Design,Design,50,"Availability Zones can be used to optimize application availability within a region by providing datacenter level fault tolerance. However, the application architecture must not share dependencies between zones to use them effectively. It is also important to note that Availability Zones may introduce performance and cost considerations for applications which are extremely 'chatty' across zones given the implied physical separation between each zone and inter-zone bandwidth charges. That also means that AZ can be considered to get higher Service Level Agreement (SLA) for lower cost. Be aware of  pricing changes coming to Availability Zone bandwidth starting February 2021."
Cost Optimization,Understand cost implications of availability strategy,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/tradeoffs,Medium,Application Design,Design,50,"As you design the workload, consider tradeoffs between cost optimization and other aspects of the design, such as security, scalability, resilience, and operability.

Cost Optimization,Consider using Service Endpoints and Private Link,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview,Medium,Security & Compliance,Network Security,50,"Service Endpoints and Private Link can be leveraged to restrict access to PaaS endpoints from only authorized virtual networks, effectively mitigating data intrusion risks and associated impact to application availability. Service Endpoints provide service level access to a PaaS service, while Private Link provides direct access to a specific PaaS resource to mitigate data exfiltration risks (e.g. malicious admin scenarios)."
Cost Optimization,Consider using shared disks for suitable workloads,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/disks-shared,Medium,Capacity & Service Availability Planning,Efficiency,50,"Shared managed disks offer shared block storage that can be accessed from multiple VMs, these are exposed as logical unit numbers (LUNs). LUNs are then presented to an initiator (VM) from a target (disk). These LUNs look like direct-attached-storage (DAS) or a local drive to the VM."
Cost Optimization,Consider using reserved Premium disks,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/disks-reserved-capacity,Medium,Capacity & Service Availability Planning,Efficiency,50,"Azure Disk Storage reservations are available only for select Azure premium SSD SKUs. The SKU of a premium SSD determines the disk's size and performance. A disk reservation is made per disk SKU. As a result, the reservation consumption is based on the unit of the disk SKUs instead of the provided size. Make sure you track the usage in disk SKUs instead of provisioned or used disk capacity."
Cost Optimization,Prefer Microsoft backbone for networking,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/,Medium,Networking & Connectivity,Connectivity,50,Are you closer to your users or on-prem? If users are closer to the cloud you should use MSFT (i.e. egress traffic). MPLS is when another service provider gives you the line.
Cost Optimization,Be aware of cross-region data transfer costs,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/provision-networking#peering,Medium,Networking & Connectivity,Data flow,50,Moving data between regions can add additional cost - both on the storage layer or networking layer. It's worth reviewing if this cost is can be replaced via re-architecture or justified due to e.g. disaster recovery (DR).
Cost Optimization,Use data lifecycle policy,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts,Medium,Health Modeling & Monitoring,Resource and Infrastructure Level Monitoring,50,"Azure storage offers different access tiers, allowing you to store blob object data in the most cost-effective manner. Available access tiers include: Hot (Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently), Cool (Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days), and Archive (Optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days with flexible latency requirements, on the order of hours)."
Cost Optimization,Be aware of extra cost when tunnelling traffic through on-premises,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/forced-tunneling,Low,Networking & Connectivity,Data flow,10,Consider the extra cost related to data ingress and egress if your application requires to use forced tunneling.
Cost Optimization,Be aware of cost implications of Web Application Firewall,https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/web-application-firewall/,Low,Networking & Connectivity,Endpoints,10,"There are cost implications to using Front Door with Web Application Firewall enabled, but it can save costs compared to using a 3rd party solution. Front Door has a good latency, because it uses unicast. If only 1 or 2 regions are required, Application Gateway can be used. There are cost implications of having a WAF - you should check pricing of hours and GB/s."
Cost Optimization,Consider shared platforms,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/design-paas,Low,Application Design,Design,10," "
Cost Optimization,Consider the ratio of non-production to production environments,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/design-resources#subscription-and-offer-type,Low,Deployment & Testing,Build Environments,10,Consider using appropriate subscriptions types for Dev workloads and ensure production workloads are deployed in the correct subscription.
Cost Optimization,Consider multi-tenant or microservices scenarios when running multiple applications,https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/microservice-applications/,Low,Capacity & Service Availability Planning,Efficiency,10,"When running multiple applications (typically in multi-tenant or microservices scenarios) density can be increased by deploying them on shared infrastructure and utilizing it more. For example: Containerization and moving to Kubernetes (Azure Kubernetes Services) enables pod-based deployment which can utilize underlying nodes efficiently. Similar approach can be taken with App Service Plans. To prevent the 'noisy neighbor' situation, proper monitoring must be in place and performance analysis must be done (if possible)."
Cost Optimization,Understand cloud-native features and implement where possible,https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/cloudnative/,Low,Application Design,Design,10,Understanding if the application is cloud-native or not provides a very useful high-level indication about potential technical debt for operability and cost efficiency.
Cost Optimization,Consider VM Zone to Zone DR,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-zone-to-zone-disaster-recovery,Low,Application Design,Design,10,Site Recovery does not move or store customer data out of the region in which it is deployed when the customer is using Zone to Zone Disaster Recovery.  Note that the egress charges that you would see in zone to zone disaster recovery would be lower than region to region disaster recovery.
Cost Optimization,Use developer SKUs for dev/test purposes,https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/dev-test/,Low,Deployment & Testing,Testing & Validation,10,"Special SKUs and subscription offers for development and testing purposes can save costs, but have to be used properly.
